Example runner to show execution of Module 4 assignment
----------------------------------------------------------------
This runner demonstrates the timing different between paged and
pinned memory with varying block size and amount of kernels.
The timing is done by nvprof as I found this to be much more
reliable and accurate than my timing method for module 3.
This runner additionally demonstrates how to run the caesar
cipher kernel with file I/O.
